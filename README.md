An updater to keep Plex Media Player up to date

This script will only keep Plex Media Player for linux up to date.

I'm not the developper behind the Plex Media Player for Linux. All credits goes to Knapsu.

This is the webpage providing the file: https://knapsu.eu/plex/

No need to contact me for Plex issues or anything Plex related, I just did the updater

**Installation:**
- copy the file in "/opt/scripts"
- chmod +x the file
- add it to cron (root account to avoid issues)
